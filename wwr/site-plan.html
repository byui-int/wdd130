      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Rafting and whitewater rafting are recreational outdoor activities which 
        use an inflatable raft to navigate a river or other body of water. 
        This is often done on whitewater or different degrees of rough water. 
        Dealing with risk is often a part of the experience.
        This activity as an adventure sport has become popular since the 1950s, 
        if not earlier, evolving from individuals paddling 10 feet (3.0 m) to 14 
        feet (4.3 m) rafts with double-bladed paddles or oars to multi-person 
        rafts propelled by single-bladed paddles and steered by a person at the stern, 
        or by the use of oars.
        Rafting on certain sections of rivers is considered an extreme sport and 
        can be fatal, while other sections are not so extreme or difficult. 
        Rafting is also a competitive sport practiced around the world which 
        culminates in a world rafting championship event between the participating 
        nations. The International Rafting Federation, often referred to as the IRF, 
        is the worldwide body which oversees all aspects of the sport.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The target market can be huge for whitewater rafting, especially in tourist 
        cities. Families or visitors looking for activities while on vacation will 
        make up a large portion of your profits, but you may also receive business 
        from die-hard water rafters who are looking to challenge themselves on the 
        next big run. A whitewater rafting business helps customers navigate rough 
        waters by supplying them with the equipment and/or the guides they need to 
        safely head down the river.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or child pages.
      </p>  
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the global navigation for the site.

Choose your pages that you will create and put the names inside the two child page boxes… Some suggestions are below:

•	FAQ
•	Blog

        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages.  They should show the major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative locations of each element.  In the wireframe below you can see there will be 6 sections to our page:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain means an image) and the navigation bar.</li>
        <li>Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the screen.</li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image </li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3  social media icons. </li>

      </ol>
