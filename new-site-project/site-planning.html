        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or child pages.
      </p>  
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the global navigation for the site.
