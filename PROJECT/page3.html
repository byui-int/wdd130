          <div class="para-5">
            <p>
              The main tips that goes for all the sites mentioned is using the
              list of categories provided by the site, searching by author’s
              names, searching specific words, or specific titles if you know
              them. If you know a specific author, say Cindy Roland Anderson,
              you can look her name up to see what books the site has to offer.
              In Kindle, Kindle Unlimited and Audible you can scroll down to see
              other authors that are similar to them. If you search up a title
              of a book you can also scroll down to see what books are similar
              to what you currently are looking at. Sometimes books by the same
              author will show, but most of the time you will see books by other
              authors that have the same story line or interest.

          <div class="para-7">
            <p>
              For Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible the category list is
              quite large. From Arts & Photography to Travel it is well broken
              down. After you pick your original topic, say Romance, you get
              into secondary categories. This is where you get to be more
              specific as to what type of ‘romance’ (or other topic) you are
              searching for. Action & Adventure, Fantasy, Paranormal, Sports.
              After you pick a second, more specific category, you are given two
              more lists to pick from. There is the list of ‘Heroes’ and
              ‘Themes’. Within these categories you can pick which you would
              like to be present and which you would not. An example of what the
              results would look like is, “Romance book with Fantasy with
              Doctors (heroes) and Vacation (themes)”. Only books with all these
              items would show up.

            <p>
              For OverDrive and Libby the same process is available however
              there are a couple extra steps. Because these sites are different
              libraries rather than a place where you can buy books you will
              have additional options to pick from. On OverDrive you can pick to
              only see books that are available to borrow now rather than seeing
              books that have a waiting list. You can also pick if you would
              like to see both audio books and reading books or just one or the
              other. There are not as many first categories to pick from, but
              they do make up for it in the secondary categories list. A
              downside to this site is you only have access to the books that
              your library has. If they do not own the book it will not be
              available. On the plus side you can have more than one library on
              your account. If you have more than one library card with
              different libraries you can better your chances as finding what
              you are looking for.
