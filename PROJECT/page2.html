              Kindle is best when you are looking for a specific book that you
              are wanting to own or spend money on, but if you are looking to
              'borrow books' and not spend as much money then Kindle Unlimited
              is the better choice. Kindle Unlimited is a subscription that you
              can get through Kindle that, for a monthly fee, you can borrow up
              to 10 books. You can keep them as long as you would like and
              change them out whenever you want. Any book that kindle has that
              is Kindle Unlimited is available for you to borrow to your hearts
              content.

              OverDrive is best for both audio and reading books as long as
              you have a good online library and can be patient. With having to
              share the copies of books available in the library sometimes wait
              lists can be as long as 8 to 12 weeks. Having the option for both
              in the same place is nice, but can sometimes be a little hard to
              actually get the book.

            <p>
              Audible is best for audio books! Audible may only offers audio
              files, but with their vast collection from books, to podcasts, to
              reviews and more you will never run out of things to listen to.
              However, like Kindle you will have to pay for the books you want
              to listen too unless you sign up for one of their programs like
              Plus Catalog. Plus Catalog is just like Kindle Unlimited but just
              for audio books.
